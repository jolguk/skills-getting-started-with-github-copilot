## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/activities`                                                     | Get all activities with their details and current participant count |
| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity                                             |
| DELETE | `/activities/{activity_name}/unregister?email=student@mergington.edu` | Unregister a participant from an activity                         |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.

## Testing

From the repository root, install the dependencies, including pytest:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the backend tests:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

You can also run `python -m pytest` from the repository root to discover all tests.

Tests use FastAPI's TestClient, so no running server is required. Each test uses
fresh activity data that is restored automatically afterward. Tests follow the
Arrange-Act-Assert pattern and cover activity listing, signup, unregistering,
validation errors, and participant state changes.
